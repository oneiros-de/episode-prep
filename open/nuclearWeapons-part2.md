Delivery Systems and Command Structure
-------------------------------------------------

* Delivery mechamisms, challenges involved in those
  - ICBM - silos
  - SRBM - subs
  - Bombers: Bombs, Cruise Missiles
  - MIRVs
  
* Tactical NWs (like: Davy Crockett) seem to be a rather odd idea.

* Interplay with warhead design
  - Size/weight reduction
  - guidance and accuracy vs. power of the bomb

* Discuss a few milestone warheads, maybe in use today?

* Are the warheads different for the different delivery mechanisms?

* Readiness, time to launch

* What is the command structure, for example, in the US




Testing, Design and Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------
* How do you test?
  - above the ground
  - under the ground (challenge of transposing the results)
  - monitoring, test -> CTBT episode

* Effects of atmospheric nuclear testing on the environment/climate.

* How many tests over history?  

* Now that testing is banned, how are NW developed and evaluated?
  - Simulate: impact of modern computing on from-scratch development 
    How do we know they are accurate? Calibration?
  - How is yield calculated without testing? 
  - What other parameters are interesting in addition to yield?
    How do you characterize a NW?
  - I seem to know that the NIF has a role there.

* Stockpile maintenance
  - What are the basic limitations to durability?
  - What is being done to maintain the stockpile?
  - How does decay affect reliabilty and safe storage?
  
* Are we still developing new NW today?
  Seems to me the hight of the dev was 1945 to 1980s?
  Not much happened since then. Correct?  

* What are the challenges in destroying NWs 
  (e.g., in the context of arms reduction)

History and Politics
-------------------------------------------------
* Rivalry between Los Alamos National Lab and Lawrence Livermore National Lab / SUNDIAL (Proposed 10 gigaton yield weapon)
* Permanent readiness (Bombers with weapons in the air)
* Historical nuclear attack readiness/response plans

* (Almost) Accidents, Losses of Weapons
  There was a B-52 above Spain ....

* Size and structure of the stockpile in the cold war and today

* Which countries have NW?
  - US
  - Russia
  - French
  - British
  - Chinese
  - Israel
  - India
  - Pakistan
  - others?

* Are there any significant differences in the NWs of different countries? 
  E.g., russian vs. US?

* Why do countries want the bomb? Can't use it, realistically!?

* Is there an agreement among historians whether "it was worth it" to 
  have NW in the cold war? 

* What do we think North Korea has today?
  - Is the knowledge to build NW available?  
  - What are the engineering challenges that are not public knowledge?
  - Or is it really about the raw materials and their refinement process?
  
* How long would it take a developed country to build a nuke
  if they decided to do so?
  - starting from unclassified, available scientific data, 
  - no financial constraints)
  - Cost and time?
